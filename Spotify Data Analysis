# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data.csv into the table 
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL 

#1. Which track name had the most popular song? 
SELECT track_name,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 1

#2. Who are the Top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT track_name,artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#3. What's the average danceability for songs that have more than 90 in popularity? 
SELECT avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
